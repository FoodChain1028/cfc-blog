## üõ†Ô∏è Notion Integration

**Create an integration**

**Create an Full Page Database**

- Start from a new or existing page in your workspace.
- Insert a new database by typing `/database` and selecting `Database - Full page`
- Give it a title. I called mine "Destinations". Click the `‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢` menu at the top right of the page, scroll to `Add connections`, and use the search bar to find the integration that you created. Click on your integration to give it access to your database.
- Before moving on, you need the ID of the database you just created.
  Copy the URL of your Notion database. Make sure you're viewing the database as a full page - If you're using the Notion desktop app, click on the `Share` button and select `Copy link`.

`https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/1ffe4fd3f5594744b0b9602d9afc4e70?v=...`

> Your link will look like the example above. The 32-character part before the **?** is your databaseID.

- Create a file named .env.local in the main directory of the project and add your Notion integration token to the first value and your database ID you just copied to the second value..

```env
NOTION_TOKEN=
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=
```
